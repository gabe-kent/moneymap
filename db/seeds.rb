# This file should ensure the existence of records required to run the application in every environment (production,
# development, test). The code here should be idempotent so that it can be executed at any point in every environment.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Example:
#
#   ["Action", "Comedy", "Drama", "Horror"].each do |genre_name|
#     MovieGenre.find_or_create_by!(name: genre_name)
#   end

# A couple of sample logins so dev/demo environments aren't empty.

# Demo data (accounts, categories, ~3 months of transactions) for the demo user only, so the
# hosted app has something to look at. Gated on "no accounts yet" rather than per-record
# find_or_create_by, since transactions have no natural unique key — safe to leave running on
# every boot (like the rest of this file) because it only ever fires once per user. Wrapped in a
# transaction so a mid-run failure can't leave partial data behind: either it all lands, or the
# guard is still false next boot and it retries cleanly. Categories use find_or_create_by! since
# some may already exist from manual testing before this seed data existed.
